# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
In this analysis we will perform the following in an attempt to understand production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress to alleviate the suffering:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.



## Linear Regression to Predict MGP

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
A statistical study that can quantity MechaCars ability to perform against competition:

> What metric or metrics are you going to test?

> What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

> What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

> What data is needed to run the statistical test?
